 Advanced Questions

21. What is the purpose of the `/etc/fstab` file?
    - Answer: The `/etc/fstab` file contains information about disk drives and partitions that should be mounted at boot time.

22. What is the difference between hard and soft links?
    - Answer: A hard link is a direct reference to the data on the disk, while a soft link (symlink) is a pointer to another file or directory.

23. How do you configure network settings in Linux?
    - Answer: Network settings can be configured using files like `/etc/network/interfaces` (Debian-based) or `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<interface>` (Red Hat-based), or using tools like `nmcli` or `ifconfig`.

26. What is the difference between `apt-get` and `apt`?
    - Answer: `apt-get` is a lower-level package management tool, while `apt` is a higher-level interface that integrates features from `apt-get` and `apt-cache`.

27. What is LVM in Linux?
    - Answer: LVM (Logical Volume Manager) allows for flexible disk management by creating logical volumes that can be resized and moved without unmounting filesystems.
