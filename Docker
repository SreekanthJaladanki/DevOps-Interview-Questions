 Basic Questions

1. What is Docker?
   - Answer: Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications inside lightweight, portable containers.

2. What are the key components of Docker?
   - Answer: The key components of Docker are Docker Engine, Docker Images, Docker Containers, Docker Compose, and Docker Swarm.

3. What is a Docker container?
   - Answer: A Docker container is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.

4. What is a Docker image?
   - Answer: A Docker image is a read-only template that contains the application code, libraries, and dependencies needed to run an application. It is used to create Docker containers.

5. What is the purpose of the Dockerfile?
   - Answer: A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a set of instructions used to build a Docker image.

6. What is Docker Hub?
   - Answer: Docker Hub is a cloud-based repository where Docker users can create, test, store, and distribute Docker images.

7. How do you create a Docker container from an image?
   - Answer: Use the `docker run` command followed by the image name, e.g., `docker run -d image_name`.

8. What is the difference between `docker run` and `docker start`?
   - Answer: `docker run` creates and starts a new container from an image, while `docker start` starts an existing, stopped container.

9. How do you list all running Docker containers?
   - Answer: Use the command `docker ps`.

10. How do you stop a running Docker container?
    - Answer: Use the command `docker stop <container_id>`.

 Intermediate Questions

11. What is Docker Compose?
    - Answer: Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using a `docker-compose.yml` file.

12. How do you build a Docker image using a Dockerfile?
    - Answer: Use the command `docker build -t image_name .` in the directory containing the Dockerfile.

13. What is the purpose of the `docker-compose.yml` file?
    - Answer: The `docker-compose.yml` file defines the services, networks, and volumes needed for a multi-container Docker application.

14. How do you scale services in Docker Compose?
    - Answer: Use the command `docker-compose up --scale service_name=num`.

15. What is the Docker Swarm?
    - Answer: Docker Swarm is Docker's native clustering and orchestration tool that allows you to manage a cluster of Docker nodes and deploy services across the cluster.

16. How do you initialize a Docker Swarm?
    - Answer: Use the command `docker swarm init`.

17. How do you create a Docker network?
    - Answer: Use the command `docker network create network_name`.

18. What is a Docker volume?
    - Answer: A Docker volume is a storage mechanism that allows you to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers.

19. How do you create a Docker volume?
    - Answer: Use the command `docker volume create volume_name`.

20. How do you attach a volume to a Docker container?
    - Answer: Use the `-v` flag with the `docker run` command, e.g., `docker run -v volume_name:/path_in_container image_name`.

 Advanced Questions

21. What is a multi-stage build in Docker?
    - Answer: A multi-stage build is a Dockerfile technique that allows you to use multiple `FROM` statements to create temporary intermediate images, reducing the final image size.

22. How do you pass environment variables to a Docker container?
    - Answer: Use the `-e` flag with the `docker run` command, e.g., `docker run -e VAR_NAME=value image_name`.

23. What is the difference between `COPY` and `ADD` in a Dockerfile?
    - Answer: `COPY` is used to copy files and directories from the build context to the container, while `ADD` can also fetch files from remote URLs and unpack local archives.

24. How do you link Docker containers?
    - Answer: Use the `--link` flag with the `docker run` command, although it is recommended to use user-defined networks instead.

25. What is Docker Machine?
    - Answer: Docker Machine is a tool that lets you install Docker Engine on virtual hosts and manage the hosts with `docker-machine` commands.

26. How do you create a Docker service in Swarm?
    - Answer: Use the command `docker service create --name service_name image_name`.

27. What is a Docker registry?
    - Answer: A Docker registry is a storage and distribution system for Docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry, while you can also set up private registries.

28. How do you push an image to a Docker registry?
    - Answer: Use the command `docker push repository_name/image_name`.

29. What is the purpose of the `docker exec` command?
    - Answer: The `docker exec` command runs a new command in a running container.

30. How do you inspect the logs of a Docker container?
    - Answer: Use the command `docker logs <container_id>`.

 Scenario-Based Questions

31. How do you handle persistent data in Docker?
    - Answer: Use Docker volumes or bind mounts to persist data outside of the container's lifecycle.

32. How do you troubleshoot a Docker container that is not starting?
    - Answer: Check the container logs with `docker logs`, inspect the container with `docker inspect`, and verify Dockerfile configurations and dependencies.

33. How do you update a running service in Docker Swarm?
    - Answer: Use the command `docker service update --image new_image_name service_name`.

34. How do you handle environment-specific configurations in Docker?
    - Answer: Use environment variables, Docker Compose overrides, or configuration files mounted as volumes.

35. How do you perform health checks on Docker containers?
    - Answer: Use the `HEALTHCHECK` instruction in the Dockerfile to define a command to test container health.

 Miscellaneous Questions

36. What is the `docker inspect` command used for?
    - Answer: The `docker inspect` command returns detailed information about Docker objects like containers, images, networks, and volumes.

37. How do you clean up unused Docker resources?
    - Answer: Use the command `docker system prune` to remove unused containers, networks, images, and build cache.

38. What is Docker's default bridge network, and how does it work?
    - Answer: The default bridge network is named `bridge`, and it allows containers to communicate with each other using IP addresses and ports.

39. How do you configure Docker to use a proxy server?
    - Answer: Set the proxy environment variables in the Docker service configuration or daemon.json file.

40. What is the purpose of the `ENTRYPOINT` instruction in a Dockerfile?
    - Answer: `ENTRYPOINT` sets the command that will always run when the container starts, making the container behave like an executable.

 Expert Questions

41. How do you handle secrets management in Docker Swarm?
    - Answer: Use Docker secrets to securely store and manage sensitive data, and mount secrets into services using the `--secret` flag.

42. What is the role of Docker overlay networks?
    - Answer: Overlay networks allow communication between containers on different Docker hosts, facilitating multi-host networking in Docker Swarm.

43. How do you ensure the security of Docker containers?
