    - Answer: Use the `parallel` block in a Declarative Pipeline or the `parallel` method in a Scripted Pipeline.

20. What are post conditions in a Jenkins pipeline?
    - Answer: Post conditions, defined in the `post` block, specify actions to be taken after the pipeline execution, such as `always`, `success`, `failure`, and `unstable`.
 Advanced Questions

21. How do you integrate Jenkins with Git?
    - Answer: Use the Git plugin, configure the repository URL in the job or pipeline, and set up credentials for accessing the repository.

22. What is the purpose of the `archiveArtifacts` step in Jenkins?
    - Answer: The `archiveArtifacts` step saves files produced during a build for later retrieval.

23. How do you configure email notifications in Jenkins?
    - Answer: Use the Email Extension plugin, configure SMTP settings, and set up email notifications in the job or pipeline configuration.

24. What is a Jenkins shared library?
    - Answer: A shared library is a collection of reusable pipeline code stored in a Git repository, which can be loaded and used across multiple Jenkins pipelines.

25. How do you handle environment variables in Jenkins?
    - Answer: Use the `env` object in pipelines or configure environment variables in the job or global configuration.

26. What is the `stash` and `unstash` feature in Jenkins?
    - Answer: `stash` saves files for later use in the same pipeline, while `unstash` retrieves those files.

27. How do you configure Jenkins for high availability?
    - Answer: Implement high availability by setting up a master-slave architecture, using load balancers, and having backup and restore mechanisms.

28. How do you use Docker with Jenkins?
    - Answer: Use the Docker plugin to run builds inside Docker containers, or use Docker as a build agent.

29. What is the `input` step in a Jenkins pipeline?
    - Answer: The `input` step pauses the pipeline and waits for user input or approval to continue.

30. How do you configure Jenkins to use a proxy server?
    - Answer: Configure the proxy settings in the Jenkins global configuration under "Manage Jenkins" -> "Manage Plugins" -> "Advanced" tab.
