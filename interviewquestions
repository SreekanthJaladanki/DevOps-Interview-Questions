4. How does continuous integration differ from continuous delivery?
Answer:
- Continuous Integration (CI): Involves automatically testing and integrating code changes into a shared repository frequently.
- Continuous Delivery (CD): Extends CI by deploying all code changes to a testing or production environment after the build stage.

5. What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?
Answer: IaC is the practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure using machine-readable configuration files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. Tools like Terraform and AWS CloudFormation are commonly used.

17. How do you manage secrets in DevOps?
Answer:
- Use secret management tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Kubernetes Secrets.
- Store secrets securely, avoiding hardcoding them in code or configuration files.
- Implement access controls and audit logs to monitor access to secrets.

18. What is the significance of the 'shift-left' approach in DevOps?
Answer: The 'shift-left' approach involves moving testing and quality assurance earlier in the software development lifecycle. This helps in identifying and addressing issues sooner, reducing costs, and improving software quality.

19. What are the benefits of using containers in DevOps?
Answer:
- Isolation: Applications run in separate environments, preventing conflicts.
- Portability: Containers can run consistently across different environments.

20. Explain the concept of continuous monitoring.
Answer: Continuous monitoring involves tracking application and infrastructure performance in real-time. It uses tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Nagios to collect metrics, logs, and traces, enabling teams to identify and resolve issues quickly, ensuring system reliability and performance.

21. What is a canary release?
Answer: A canary release is a deployment strategy where a new version of an application is rolled out to a small subset of users before full deployment. This allows teams to test the new features in production with minimal risk, gathering feedback and identifying potential issues early.

22. How do you handle configuration drift in DevOps?
Answer:
- Use configuration management tools like Ansible or Chef to define and enforce desired states.

- Microservices Architecture: Composed of small, independent services that communicate over a network. Each service focuses on a specific business function, allowing for independent deployment and scaling.

32. Explain the concept of “immutable infrastructure.”
Answer: Immutable infrastructure means that servers or components are not modified after deployment. Instead of updating or patching existing servers, new instances with the desired configuration are deployed, and the old ones are decommissioned. This reduces configuration drift and enhances consistency.

33. What are some common metrics you monitor in a production environment?
Answer:
- CPU and Memory Usage: To ensure resources are utilized efficiently.
- Response Time: To measure how quickly the application responds to requests.
